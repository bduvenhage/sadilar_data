As the residents of Harry Gwala Park, we have been registering for houses for quite a long time but we do not get them. We have registered three times, but we do not get them. We are asking for assistance from your side. Recently we tried to register for the last time but still our names are not on the waiting list.

We were promised to get other names which are on the list but we do not see them coming up instead time is passing. The only thing happening is that people from Mthatha are getting their houses and we do not know where they were registered. We are renting while waiting for our houses. We have submitted our documents and it is nice to do so but there is nothing happening. We are earnestly asking for houses.

Tebogo Ndlovu 0849713502. I am not satisfied because even though I registered for a house, I have not yet received it. I pay R600 rent a month. I am staying in Matatiele where I was born. I do not know what  I must do to get the house, if there is a chance of buying one then I am willing to buy.
